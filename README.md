 3D Game Development with Unity Assets/Art   
 I will be uploading the assets (such as sound, art, 3D models, etc.) I will be making (or downloading from Unity asset store) for my game.   
 I am following the book called **3D Game Development with Unity** by Franz Lanzinger to learn how to develop games in Unity for future projects.
