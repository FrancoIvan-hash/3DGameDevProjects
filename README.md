# 3DGameDevProjects

This is GitHub repository is meant to contain and document my 3D game projects done in Unity following the book: **3D Game Development with Unity**  
I will be uploading the assets (such as sound, art, 3D models, etc.) I will be making (or downloading from Unity asset store) for my games.

So far, I have finished **toycar**, a 3D race-ish game. This project helped me get acquainted with Unity.  
I am currently working on **DotGame 3D** to learn more about 3D modeling using Blender, as well as learn intermediate/advance skills to build a playable game.  
My goal is to start my own games and publish them to get exposed to the Game Industry.
